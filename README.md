My old Android File Browser code

I stopped development when Android removed permission to read/write to the file system.
There may be a way to do so now, but I am not working on mobile software much anymore.

Feel free to fork and continue the app as y'all see fit.
I started it as a way to learn Android programming.
I even lead the pack with some of my features for a time.
However, demands on my time and Android's increasingly burdensome processes have
resulted in me stepping back from maintaining this free app.

Thanks to everyone that enjoyed it!
